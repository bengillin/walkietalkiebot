# Talkboy

A voice-first, avatar-based interface for Claude Code. Talk to a friendly AI companion instead of typing in a terminal.

## Vision

Make AI-assisted coding accessible to everyone by replacing the command line with a conversational avatar you can speak to naturally.

## Core Features

- **Voice Interface**: Speak naturally, hear responses read back
- **Animated Avatar**: A friendly character that reacts to conversation
- **Visual Workspace**: See what's happening without reading terminal output
- **Customizable Companions**: Choose or create your own avatar

## Project Status

Planning phase - defining scope and architecture
